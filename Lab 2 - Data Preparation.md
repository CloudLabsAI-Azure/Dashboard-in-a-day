## Power BI Desktop – Data Preparation

In this section, we will explore methods to [transform data in the data model](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/powerbi-desktop-shape-and-combine-data/). Transforming the data by renaming tables, updating data types, and appending tables together ensures that the data is ready to be used for reporting. In some instances, this means cleaning the data up so that similar sets of data can be combined. In other instances, groups of data are renamed so that they are more easilyrecognized by end users and report writing is simplified.

### Power BI Desktop - Renaming tables

The Query Editor window should appear as shown below.

 - If formula bar is disabled, you can turn on the formula bar from the **View** ribbon. This enables you to see the “M” code generated by each click on the ribbons.
 - Click the options available on the ribbon, **Home**, **Transform**, **Add Column**, and **View**, to review the various features available. 

1. Under the **Queries** panel, minimize the **Transform Files from InternationalSales** folder.

2. Click each query name in the **Other Queries** section.

   ![](Images/powerbi-01-25.png)
   
3. Navigate to **Query Settings**, and then the **Properties** section to rename the queries as shown below:

   | Initial Name             | Final Name            |
   | ------------------------ | --------------------- |
   | sales                    |  `Sales`              |
   | Product_Table            |  `Product`            |
   | geo                      | `Geography`           |
   | manufacturer             | `Manufacturer`        |
   | InternationalSales       | `International Sales` |

  >**Note**: It is a best practice to provide descriptive query names and column names. These names are used in visuals and in the Q&A section, which is covered later in the lab.  
    
### Power BI Desktop – Filling empty values

In our scenario, some of the data is not in the right format. Power BI provides extensive transformation capabilities to clean and prepare data to meet your needs. Let’s start with the Product query.

Notice that the **Category** column has a lot of null values. Hover over the green/gray bar (known as the quality bar) below the column header. This allows you to easily identify errors and empty values in your data previews. It looks like there are values in the Category column only when the value changes. We need to provide data in this column so there are values in each row.

   ![](Images/powerbi-01-26.png)

4. In the left panel, click the **Product Query**. 

5. Click the **Category** column.

6. From the ribbon, click Transform, click Fill, and then click Down.

   ![](Images/powerbi-01-27.png)

Notice how all the null values are filled with the appropriate Category values.

### Power BI Desktop – Splitting columns

In the Product query, notice the Product column. It looks like the product name and product segmentare concatenated into one field with a pipe (|) separator. Let’s split them into two columns. This will be useful when we build visuals, so we can analyze based on both fields.

7. From the left panel, click the **Product** Query. 

8. Click the **Product** column.

9. From the ribbon, click **Transform**, click **Split Column**, and then click **By Delimiter**. The Split **Column by Delimiter dialog** box opens.

10. In the dialog box, make sure that **Custom** is selected in the **Select or enter delimiter** drop-down menu.

    >**Note**: The **Select or enter delimiter** drop-down menu has some of the standard delimiters like comma, colon, and so on.

11. Notice that in the text area, there is a hyphen (-). Power BI assumes we want to split by hyphen. Remove the hyphen symbol and enter the **pipe symbol** (|) as shown in the screenshot.

12. Click **OK**.

    ![](Images/powerbi-01-28.png)
    
    >**Note**: If the delimiter occurs multiple times, the **Split at** section provides the option to split only once (either left most or right most) or the option to split the column on each occurrence of the delimiter.

In this scenario, the delimiter occurs only once, therefore the Product column is split into two columns.

### Power BI Desktop – Renaming columns

Let’s rename the columns.

13. Click the **Product.1** column, and then **right-click** next to the column name.

14. Click **Rename…** from the selection menu.

15. **Rename** the field to **Product**.

16. Following these steps, also rename **Product.2** to **Segment**.

    ![](Images/powerbi-01-29.png)
        
### Power BI Desktop – Removing unwanted rows

In the **Geography** query, notice that the first two rows are informational. They are not part of the data. Similarly, in the Manufacturer query, the last couple of rows are not part of the data. Let’s remove them so we have a clean dataset.

17. In the left panel, click the **Geography** query.

18. From the ribbon, click **Home**, click **Reduce Rows**, and then click **Remove Rows** dropdown and then select **Remove Top Rows**

19. The **Remove Top Rows** dialog box opens. Enter **2** in the text box since we want to remove the top informational data row and the blank second row.

20. Click **OK**.

    ![](Images/remove_row.png)
    
Notice the first row in the Geography query is now the column header. Let’s make it a header.

>**Note**: If in collapsed state we can directly select the **Remove Rows** under **Reduce Rows**

   ![](Images/powerbi_01_54.png)

21. With **Geography** query selected in the left panel, from the ribbon click **Home**, and then click **Use First Row as Headers**.

With that step, Power BI will predict the data type of each field again.

Notice that the column **Zip** was changed to the number data type. Let’s change it to text as we did earlier. If we don’t, we will see errors when we load the data.

22. Click **123** next to the Zip Column. From the dialog box, click **Text**.

23. Click **Replace Current** in the **Change Column Type** dialog box.

    ![](Images/powerbi-01-35.png)

24. From the left panel, click the **Manufacturer** query. Notice the bottom three rows are not part of the data. Let’s remove them.

25. From the ribbon, click **Home**, click **Reduce Rows**, then click **Remove Rows** dropdown and then select **Remove Bottom Rows**
 
    ![](Images/remove_bottomrow.png)

26. The **Remove Bottom Rows** dialog box opens. Enter **3** in the **Number of rows text box**.

27. Click **OK**.
   
### Power BI Desktop – Transposing data

28. From the left panel, click the **Manufacturer** Query. Notice that the **ManufacturerID**, **Manufacturer**, and **Logo** data is laid across in rows. Also notice that the header is not useful. We need to transpose the table to meet our needs.

29. From the ribbon click **Transform** and then click **Transpose**.

    ![](Images/powerbi-01-37.png)
    
Notice that this transposes the data into columns. Now we need the first row to be the header.

30. From the ribbon click **Home** and then click **Use First Row as Headers**.

    ![](Images/powerbi-01-38.png)

Notice that now the **Manufacturer** table is laid out the way we need it with a header and values along columns.

Also notice that on the right panel under **APPLIED STEPS** you will see the list of transformations and steps that have been applied. You can navigate through each change made to the data by clicking on the step. Steps can also be deleted by clicking on the **X** that appears to the left of the step. The properties of each step can be reviewed by clicking on the **gear** to the right of the step. 

### Power BI Desktop – Appending queries

To analyze the Sales of all countries, it is convenient to have a single **Sales** table. To do this, you need to append all the rows from the **International Sales** query to the **Sales** query.

31. Click **Sales** in the Queries window in the left panel as shown above.

32. From the ribbon click **Home** and then click **Append Queries** under Combine. 

    The **Append** dialog box opens. There is an option to append **Two tables** or **Three or more tables**. 
    
    Leave **Two tables** selected since we are appending just two tables.

33. Click **International Sales** from the drop-down and then click **OK**.

    ![](Images/powerbi-01-39.png)
    
You will now see a new column in the **Sales** table called **Country**. Since the International **Sales** query had the additional column for **Country**, Power BI Desktop added the column to the **Sales** table when it loaded the values from the **International Sales** query.

You will see **null values** in the **Country** column by default for the **Sales** table rows because that column did not exist for the table with USA data. We will now add the value “**USA**” as a data shaping operation. 

34. From the ribbon click **Add Column** and then click **Conditional Column**.

    ![](Images/powerbi-01-40.png)
    
35. In the **Add Conditional Column** dialog box, enter the name of the column as “**CountryName**”.

36. Click **Country** from the **Column Name** drop-down menu.

37. Click **equals** from the **Operator** drop-down menu.

38. Enter **null** in the **Values** text.

39. Enter **USA** in the **Output** text.

40. Click the drop-down menu under **Else** and then click the **Select a column** option.

41. Click **Country** from the column drop-down menu.

42. Click **OK**.

    ![](Images/powerbi-01-41.png)
    
This reads: if current Country value equals null then the value should be USA otherwise use the current Country value

43. You will see the **CountryName** column in the Query editor window.

    ![](Images/powerbi-01-42.png)
    
The original **Country** column is only required as a temporary column. It is not required in the final table for analysis and can be removed.

44. Right-click on the **Country** column and click **Remove** as shown in the figure.
 
    ![](Images/powerbi-01-43.png)
    
We can now rename the **CountryName** column to **Country**. 

45. Right-click on the **CountryName** column and rename it to **Country**.

46. Using Home then **Data Type** or by selecting the data type next to the column header, change the **data type** of the **Country** column to **Text**.

47. Using **Home** then **Data Type** or by selecting the data type next to the column header, change the **data type** of the **Revenue** column to **Fixed Decimal Number** because it is a currency field.

When the data is refreshed, it will process through all the “Applied Steps” that you have created.
 
The newly named **Country** column will have names for all countries, including the USA. You can validate this by clicking on the drop-down menu next to the **Country** column to see the unique values. 

48. At first, you will only see USA data. Click **Load more** to validate you have data from all eight countries. 

49. Click **OK** to close this filter.

    ![](Images/powerbi-01-44.png)
    
Typically, when exploring data, we load a subset of data. There are multiple ways to do this. From the ribbon, you can click **Home**, click **Keep Rows**, and then click **Keep Top Rows**. Another way to load a subset of data is to navigate to **Home**, then click **Keep Rows** and then click **Keep Bottom Rows**. A third method is to click **Home**, click **Keep Rows**, and then click **Keep Range of Rows**. You can use any of these options to filter down to a subset of data.

Our dataset has data from 2014 to 2021. For our analysis we want to start with the last three years of data (2019-2021). We don’t yet know how many rows will result. We can filter by year to get the subset.

50. Click the **arrow** next to **Date** in the **Sales** Query.

51. Click **Date Filters** and then click **In the Previous…**

    ![](Images/powerbi-01-45.png)
    
52. The **Filter Rows** dialog box opens. Enter **3** in the text box next to **is in the previous**.

53. Click **years** from the drop-down menu.

54. Click **OK**.

    ![](Images/powerbi-01-46.png)
    
Now that the International Sales data is appended to the Sales query, we don’t need the International Sales table to load into the data model. Let’s prevent the International Sales table from loading into the data model. 

55. From the Queries panel on the left, click the **International Sales** query.

56. Right-click and then click **Enable Load**. This will disable loading International Sales.

    ![](Images/powerbi-01-47.png)
    
     >**Note**: The appropriate data from the International Sales table will load into the Sales table each time the model is refreshed. By removing the International Sales table, we are preventing duplicate data from loading into the model and increasing its file size. In some instances, storing very large amounts 
of data affects the data model performance.
 
57. From the ribbon click **View** and then click **Query Dependencies**.

This opens the **Query Dependencies** dialog box. The dialog box shows the source of each query and its dependencies. For example, we see that the Sales query has a CSV file source and a dependency on the International Sales query. This is a useful information to share knowledge with your team members.

   ![](Images/powerbi-01-48.png)

58. Click **Close** in the dialog box.

Note that you can zoom in and out of the **Query Dependencies** view as needed.

You have now successfully completed import and data shaping operations and are ready to load the data into the Power BI Desktop data model to visualize the data. 

59. Click **File** and then click **Close & Apply**. This will close out the power query window and apply all changes.

    ![](Images/powerbi-01-49.png)
    
    All the data will be loaded in memory in the Power BI Desktop. You will see the progress dialog box with the number of rows being loaded in each table as shown in the Figure.
    
    ![](Images/powerbi-01-50.png)
    
    >**Note**: It may take several minutes to load all the tables.

60. Click **File** and then click **Save** to save the file after the data loading is complete. Name the file as “**MyFirstPowerBIModel**”. Save the file in the DIAD Reports (**\DIAD\Reports**) folder.

61. On the left panel, click **Data ![](Images/powerbi-01-51.png) icon**  to view the data that was loaded. If you need to open Power Query editor, navigate to Home -> Transform Data -> Transform data.
