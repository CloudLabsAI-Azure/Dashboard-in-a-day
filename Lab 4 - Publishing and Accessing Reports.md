## Introduction

This document is lab four out of five total labs.

Please continue to use your file after completing Lab 3. If you are joining the DIAD at this point or were unable to complete previous labs, please start this lab with the provided **DIAD Final Report.pbix** file located in the **Reports** folder.

At the end of this lab, you will have completed a full report that is ready to be published to the Power BI Service. By creating the report, you will have learned how to do conditional formatting, add a logo to the manufacturer filter, import a custom visual, and apply a custom theme to the report. By the end of this lab, you will have also learned how to add bookmarks to tell a story about the report.

The flow of this document includes screenshots to provide a visual aid for you and text descriptions of the steps you need to follow. In the screenshots, sections are highlighted with red or orange boxes to indicate the action or area on which you need to focus.

Power BI quickly searches different subsets of your dataset while applying a set of sophisticated algorithms to discover potentially interesting insights. You can run insights against a dataset or a dashboard tile.

Let’s generate insights on a dashboard tile. When we run insights on a dashboard tile, instead of searching for insights against an entire dataset, the search is narrowed to the data used to create a single dashboard tile. This is often referred to as scoped insights.

66. Hover over the **line chart** on the dashboard.

67. Click the **ellipse** on the top right corner.

68. Click **View Insights**.

    ![](Images/powerbi-04-34.png)
  
You will be navigated to **Focus mode** for the line chart.

69. Scroll on the Insights panel to review the various insights Power BI can generate. Notice that there is an option to pin insight visuals to the dashboard.

    ![](Images/powerbi-04-35.png)

70. Click **Exit Focus mode** in the top left to navigate back to the dashboard.

We want to be notified when VanArsdel’s Market Share goes above or below a threshold. We can set up alerts to achieve this.

71. Hover over **VanArsdel Market Share** tile.

72. Click on the **ellipse** in the top right corner of the tile.

73. Click **Manage alerts**. The **Manage alerts** dialog box opens.

74. Click **Add alert rule** dialog.

    ![](Images/powerbi-04-36.png)
  
Notice that you can add **Above** or **Below threshold**. You can also set the notification frequency. This is just an introduction to managing alerts. Complete functionality is not covered in this lab.

75. Click **Cancel** to close the dialog box.

76. Click **Don’t Save**.

77. Click on the **VanArsdel Market Share** tile to navigate to the report.

    ![](Images/powerbi-04-37.png)

You will be navigated to the **By Manufacturer** page of the report with the **Australia** filter applied to the report page.

79. Hover over the **matrix** visual.

80. Click the **focus mode** icon on the top right corner of the visual.

81. Click the double-down arrow to drill down.

82. Click **Back to report.**

    ![](Images/powerbi-04-38.png)
  
83. From the top menu, click **Bookmarks** and then click **Show more bookmarks**. The **Bookmark** pane opens on the right. There are two options: **Personal** bookmarks and **Report** bookmarks.

    ![](Images/powerbi-04-39.png)
  
- Report bookmarks are the bookmarks the report author created (we did this in Power BI Desktop).

- Personal bookmarks on the report are ones which the consumer can create on their own.

84. Click **View** in the **Report** bookmarks pane.

Notice that you can view and navigate through the bookmarks using the arrow at the bottom of the screen. This behavior is like in Power BI Desktop.

87. Click the **ellipse**.

88. Click **Get quick Insights**.

    ![](Images/powerbi-04-41.png)
  
It might take a few minutes for the insights to be created. Once insights are ready, a message appears in the top right corner.

89. Click **View insights.**

    ![](Images/powerbi-04-42.png)
  
A quick insights report is displayed based on the dataset. This provides insights into data you may have missed and helps to get a quick start on creating dashboards. Hovering over each report provides an option to **Pin it** to a dashboard.

  ![](Images/powerbi-04-43.png)

You’ve now completed Lab four! Throughout this lab, you have learned how to apply conditional formatting, add a logo to the manufacturer filter, import a custom visual, and apply a custom theme to the report. You also learned how to add bookmarks to tell a story about the report.
