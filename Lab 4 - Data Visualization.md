## Introduction

**IMPORTANT**:heavy_exclamation_mark:: Please start this lab with the provided **Lab 2 solution.pbix** file found in the **"C:\DIAD\Reports"** in the Lab Virtual machine.

At the end of this lab, you will have completed a full report that is ready to be published to the Power BI Service. In the report, you will have learned how to do conditional formatting, add a logo to the manufacturer filter, import a custom visual, and apply a custom theme to the report. By the end of this lab, you will have also learned how to add bookmarks to tell a story about the report.

The flow of this document includes screenshots to provide a visual aid for the users and a text description of the steps the user needs to follow. In the screenshots, sections are highlighted with red or orange boxes to indicate the action or area on which a user needs to focus.

## Power BI Desktop

### Power BI Desktop – Data Visualization

Now that we’ve completed data exploration and visualization in labs one and two, you have good insights to share with your team. In this section, you create a professional report for the benefit of you and your entire team.

At the end of this section, you will build a report like the one shown in the screenshot below.

  ![](Images/powerbi-03-01.png)

Now let’s get started, we will pick up where we left off at the end of Lab 2.

1. With the **Matrix** visual selected, navigate to the **Values** section and click the arrow next to **% Growth**.

2. Click **Conditional Formatting** and then click Background color. The **Background color** dialog box opens. This dialog provides options to format the report background color using either rules or diverging colors.

   ![](Images/powerbi-03-02.png)

3. Click on the Add a middle color checkbox.

4. Click **OK**.

   ![](Images/powerbi-03-03.png)
 
>**Note:** Conditional formatting can also be based on another column using the **Color based on** the drop-down menu.

Initially, we added a filter to load three years of data. Let’s load the complete data now.

5. From the **ribbon**, click **Home** and then click **Transform Data**. The **Power Query Editor** window opens.

6. Click the **filter** button on the **Date** column.

7. Click **Clear filter** to remove the 3-year filter.

   ![](Images/powerbi-03-04.png)

8. Click **Home** and then click **Close & Apply** to load the data.

This time all the data will be loaded. It might take a couple of minutes as we are loading approximately seven million rows.

Make sure the report is filtered by VanArsdel using the **Manufacturer** slicer. Remove all other filters.

9. Enable drill down mode on the **Revenue by Country** visual

   ![](Images/powerbi-03-05.png)

10. Click **Australia** to drill down to **State.**

11. Disable drill mode on the **Revenue by Country and State** visual

At this point, your report page should look like the screenshot below.

   ![](Images/powerbi-03-06.png)

Once data is loaded, notice **Revenue by Year visual**. You will see columns for years 2014 through 2021.

12. Hover over **Manufacturer slicer** visual.

13. On the top right corner, click the **arrow**.

14. Click **List**.

    ![](Images/powerbi-03-07.png)

15. In the **Visualizations** panel, click the **paint roller** icon. This opens the formatting options available for a visual.

16. To expand the **General** section, click **Horizontal** in the **Orientation** drop-down menu.

17. Notice the **Slicer** visual is updated. You can resize the visual, so all the manufacturers are listed horizontally.

    ![](Images/powerbi-03-08.png)

>**Note**: There are other options to change the outline color, weight, and more.

18. Click **VanArsdel**.

19. Now, collapse the **General** section.

>**Note:** Notice there is an option to enable the **Select All** option in the visual. There is also an option to make the slicer multi-select. Feel free to explore other formatting options.

Now it would be nice to add logos of the manufacturer to the slicer. Let’s do it.

20. From the **Fields** section, click the **Logo** field in the **Manufacturer** table

21. From the ribbon, click **Column** tools, click **Data Category** and then click **Image URL.** Setting the data category to **Image URL** helps Power BI understand that it is a URL so it can access the data.

    ![](Images/powerbi-03-09.png)

22. From the canvas, click the **Manufacturer** slicer.

23. From the **Fields** section, drag and drop the **Logo** from the **Manufacturer** table to the **Field** box replacing the **Manufacturer** column.

24. **Resize** the slicer visual as needed.

    ![](Images/powerbi-03-10.png)

25. Click the **VanArsdel** logo to filter all the other visuals.

26. Click the **Revenue by Year** visual.

27. From **Visualizations** panel, click the **Line and clustered** column chart to change the visual type.

28. From the **Fields** section, drag and drop the **% Growth** field from the **Sales** table to the **Line values**.

    ![](Images/powerbi-03-11.png)

This provides a representation of the revenue and growth over time.

29. Now let’s click the **Revenue Card** visual so we can change it to a **Gauge** visual.

30. From the **Visualizations** panel, click the **Gauge** visual.

31. From the **Fields** section, drag and drop the **PY Sales** field to the **Target value**.

    ![](Images/powerbi-03-12.png)

32. Resize the visual as needed. Now we can compare **Revenue** with the target.

Now let’s take time to select the colors of the visuals.

33. Click the **Gauge** visual.

34. From the **Visualizations** panel, click the **paint roller** icon.

35. Expand the **Data Colors** section.

36. Click the arrow next to **Fill** color.

38. From the ribbon, click **View**, click **Themes**, and then click **Temperature**.

    ![](Images/powerbi-03-14.png)

Notice that the colors on all the visuals are updated. Feel free to try the other out-of-the-box themes.

In our scenario, the Marketing department has provided standard color themes to be used across reports. We can use the **Report Theme** feature in Power BI by uploading a theme. The **Report Theme** requires a JSON file where the data colors, background, foreground, and a table of accent colors are defined. The JSON file can be used across all the reports.

39. From the ribbon, click **View**, click **Themes**, and then click **Browse for themes**.

40. A file browser dialog box opens. Navigate to the **Data** folder then the **Theme** folder (/Data/Theme).

41. Click the **DIADTheme2** file and then click **Open**.

    ![](Images/powerbi-03-15.png)

42. Once the theme is imported, a success dialog box opens. Click **Close**.

    ![](Images/powerbi-03-16.png)

Notice colors on all the visuals are updated. Your report should look like the screenshot at this point. This theme looks good. Now, most of the visuals are blue, so let’s add some contrast.

>**Note:** Here you can save and add your custom themes.

43. Click the **Gauge** visual.

44. From the **Visualizations** panel, click the **paint roller** icon.

Out of the box, Power BI has a large selection of visuals. However, there may be a use-case when you need a custom visual. To meet this requirement, the visualization engine is open-sourced. The Power BI community contributes visuals in the marketplace. You can add and use these visuals in your reports.

There is also an option to create your own visual and import it into Power BI Desktop.

Now let’s add a custom visual.

     ![](Images/powerbi-03-33.png)

**Note**: Notice the checkmark in the blue star. This image is used to identify certified custom visuals. Custom visuals that meet Power BI teams coding requirements are certified. Certified custom visuals support features like export to PowerPoint and the ability to display in subscription emails which are not supported by non-certified custom visuals.

107. The **import custom visual** dialog opens. Click Get it now

     ![](Images/powerbi-03-34.png)
